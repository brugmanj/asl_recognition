# ASL Recognition

## Problem Statement

Recently the importance of American Sign Language has been more important in my life. I have friends who work with the deaf, and they talk about how important it is to have a translator. One important factor to me is being able to talk with anyone. Recently, due to technological advantages, most smartphones are able to atleast do a rudimentary translation service which works. By speaking into your phone, it will automatically translate to and from your chosen language. My goal is to have a similar idea to be working with ASL. My goal for this project would be to create an application where we can identify the alphabet signs from videos.
